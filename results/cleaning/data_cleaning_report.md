## ðŸ”¬ Cleaning Methodology

### Missing Value Handling Strategy
- **Critical fields** (IDs, dates): Row removal for data integrity
- **Numerical fields**: Median imputation or business logic defaults
- **Categorical fields**: Mode imputation or "UNKNOWN" placeholder
- **Business context**: Domain-specific defaults (e.g., 'INACTIVE' for membership)

### Outlier Treatment Approach
- **Price data**: IQR-based capping to business-reasonable ranges
- **Product codes**: Statistical bounds from outlier analysis
- **Validation**: Business logic checks for data consistency
- **Preservation**: Outlier flags maintained for transparency

### Data Quality Assurance
- **Duplicate removal**: Applied to reference data (customers, articles)
- **Transaction duplicates**: Preserved as legitimate multi-quantity purchases
- **Validation flags**: Added for all corrections and imputations
- **Type optimisation**: Categorical encoding for memory efficiency

## ðŸ’¡ Data Quality Recommendations

### Production Implementation
1. **Automated validation**: Implement real-time checks during data ingestion
2. **Monitoring dashboards**: Track data quality metrics over time
3. **Business review**: Regular validation of cleaning rules with domain experts
4. **Documentation**: Maintain audit trail of all cleaning decisions

### Advanced Enhancements
1. **Machine learning imputation**: Consider more sophisticated missing value prediction
2. **Outlier detection**: Implement adaptive thresholds based on seasonal patterns
3. **Data lineage**: Track data transformations for regulatory compliance
4. **Quality scoring**: Develop composite quality metrics for each record

## ðŸ“Š Technical Implementation Details

### Processing Framework
- **Engine**: Polars for high-performance data processing
- **Memory optimisation**: Lazy evaluation and streaming for large datasets
- **Type system**: Categorical encoding and memory-efficient data types
- **Validation**: Business rule engine with configurable thresholds

### Quality Assurance Features
- **Audit trails**: Complete tracking of all cleaning operations
- **Rollback capability**: Original data preserved for validation
- **Statistical validation**: Pre/post cleaning quality comparisons
- **Business logic**: Domain-specific validation rules
