## Customer Segment Analysis

### Cluster 0: Premium Frequent Shoppers (7.6% - 39,948 customers)

### Cluster 1: Disengaged Non-Members (37.9% - 198,840 customers)

**Key Metrics:**

- **Purchase Frequency:** 6.90 transactions (moderate)
- **Recency:** 38.07 days (poor engagement)
- **Club Membership:** 0% active (completely non-engaged)
- **Fashion News Engagement:** 1% (minimal interest)

**Customer Profile:**
The largest customer segment but with significant engagement challenges. These customers show modest spending patterns, limited purchase frequency, and crucially, zero participation in the club program. They represent a massive opportunity for conversion and engagement improvement.

**Business Strategy:**
- **Club Conversion Campaigns:** Targeted messaging highlighting club benefits
- **Value Propositions:** Clear communication of membership advantages
- **Re-engagement Programs:** Email marketing with compelling offers
- **Personalised Recommendations:** Use purchase history for targeted product suggestions

- **Purchase Frequency:** 2.03 transactions (lowest)
- **Recency:** 47.61 days (poorest engagement)
- **Club Membership:** 17% active (limited participation)
- **Fashion News Engagement:** 18% (low interest)

**Customer Profile:**
At-risk customer segment with minimal purchasing activity and engagement. Despite some club membership (17%), they show very low transaction frequency and monetary value. This segment requires immediate intervention to prevent churn.

**Business Strategy:**
- **Win-Back Campaigns:** Aggressive re-engagement with compelling offers
- **Entry-Level Promotions:** Low-threshold incentives to encourage initial purchases

- **Fashion News Engagement:** 100% (complete engagement)
- **Demographics:** 46.4 years average (oldest segment)

**Customer Profile:**
Paradoxical segment showing maximum engagement with brand communications and loyalty programs but minimal purchasing activity. These mature customers (46+ years) are highly brand-loyal but need activation to convert engagement into transactions.

**Business Strategy:**
- **Activation Campaigns:** Convert brand loyalty into purchasing behaviour
- **Targeted Product Recommendations:** Age-appropriate and style-matched offerings
- **Exclusive Member Benefits:** Leverage their high engagement with special offers
- **Content Marketing:** Continue fashion news engagement while driving purchase decisions

- **Demographics:** 33.2 years average (younger segment)

**Customer Profile:**
Well-engaged club members with reasonable purchasing activity. This younger demographic (33 years) shows consistent moderate-value transactions and full engagement with brand communications. They represent significant growth potential through strategic upselling.

**Business Strategy:**
- **Upselling Campaigns:** Encourage higher-value purchases and premium products

- **Trend-Focused Marketing:** Leverage younger demographic's interest in fashion trends

## Strategic Insights and Recommendations

### Key Business Insights

3. **Engagement Opportunity:** 37.9% of customers (Cluster 1) are completely unengaged with club benefits, representing massive conversion potential.
